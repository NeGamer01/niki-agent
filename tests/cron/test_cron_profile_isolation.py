"""Regression tests for #4707 — cron must be per-profile.

Design intent (Teknium, June 2026): a profile's cron jobs both LIVE in that
profile's NIKI_HOME and EXECUTE under it.

- Storage: a job created under profile ``coder`` writes to
  ``~/.niki/profiles/coder/cron/jobs.json`` — NOT the shared default root.
- Execution: the profile-scoped gateway's in-process ticker resolves the
  active NIKI_HOME (profile home) at call time, so jobs run with that
  profile's ``.env`` / ``config.yaml`` / scripts / skills.

This is the opposite direction from the (reverted) #50112/#32091 "anchor at the
shared root" approach. Anchoring at the root funnels every profile's jobs into
one store and runs them under whatever NIKI_HOME the ticker happens to have —
leaking config/credentials/skills across profiles, the security boundary #4707
was filed for. These tests pin per-profile isolation so a stale-branch merge or
a re-anchor "fix" can't silently flip it back.
